## âœ¨ Features

* **Local & Private:** Runs entirely on your machine using the **Ollama** server (no external API keys or costs).
* **OS-Aware Context:** Gathers context (OS, shell, current directory) to suggest the correct command (e.g., `tasklist` on Windows, `ps aux` on Linux).
* **Safe Execution:** Requires user confirmation before executing any suggested command, preventing accidental changes.
* **State-Changing Support:** Handles complex commands like `cd` (change directory) by executing them directly in the current shell session.
* **Cross-Platform:** Includes setup scripts for **Bash/Zsh (Linux/macOS)** and **PowerShell (Windows)**.
